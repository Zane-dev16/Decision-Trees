# Decision Trees Learning Repository

This repository serves as an educational purpose, learning and breaking down Decision Trees with scikit-learn. In the notebooks we use Decision Trees to classify the iris dataset, the moons dataset and several randomly generated datasets. Also we get under the hood of decision trees and tweak and learn about it's hyperparameter.
